To tackle this challenge, you'll mainly need to write code that interacts with the provided API and implements a strategy to optimize fuel delivery, balancing costs and CO₂ emissions while minimizing penalties. Here's how to start:

1. Set Up Your Environment
Install Java 17 and Maven if they aren’t already installed, as the backend is built using Spring Boot.
Clone the repository and open the project in an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or VS Code.
Start the backend locally to test your code, using:
bash
Copiază codul
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=local
Set up a REST client (like Postman or Bruno) to manually test API endpoints, especially if you’re new to the API and want to explore its behavior.
2. Understand API Requests and Responses
Explore the Swagger UI (http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html) for documentation on API endpoints. This shows you the structure of requests and responses, like how to start sessions and send movements.
Session Management: The game starts at day 0. You’ll use the API to start a session and send fuel movement data each day.
Daily Movement: At each “day” in the game, you’ll make decisions about fuel transportation and storage, and send these to the backend.
3. Write Code to Send Requests
Set Up API Calls: Use a library like HTTPClient in Java, requests in Python, or Axios in JavaScript to send POST requests with the required headers and data.
Start the Session: Begin by writing code to initialize a session:
java
Copiază codul
HttpResponse<String> response = client.send(
  HttpRequest.newBuilder()
    .uri(URI.create("http://localhost:8080/api/v1/session/start"))
    .header("API-KEY", "7bcd6334-bc2e-4cbf-b9d4-61cb9e868869")
    .POST(HttpRequest.BodyPublishers.noBody())
    .build(),
  HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString()
);
4. Implement a Strategy for Fuel Movements
Design an Algorithm to manage and optimize fuel deliveries.
Analyze Requirements: Each round, decide how much fuel to send, from where to where, and by what method (pipeline or truck).
Constraints: Respect capacity limits and delivery windows to avoid penalties.
Optimization: Focus on routes, timing, and method to reduce costs and emissions.
Example Code for Daily Movement:
java
Copiază codul
Map<String, Object> movements = new HashMap<>();
movements.put("source", "refinery1");
movements.put("destination", "storage1");
movements.put("amount", 500);

HttpResponse<String> moveResponse = client.send(
  HttpRequest.newBuilder()
    .uri(URI.create("http://localhost:8080/api/v1/movements"))
    .header("API-KEY", "7bcd6334-bc2e-4cbf-b9d4-61cb9e868869")
    .POST(HttpRequest.BodyPublishers.ofString(new Gson().toJson(movements)))
    .build(),
  HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString()
);
5. Review Responses and Adjust Strategy
The API response will provide cost and CO₂ KPIs along with penalties for each day. Use this information to refine your approach.
Example Adjustments:
If you’re penalized for exceeding storage capacity, adjust movement quantities or delivery timing.
If CO₂ emissions are too high, prioritize routes or methods with lower emissions.
6. Loop Through Days and Finalize
Repeat the API calls each day, updating movements based on KPIs and penalties.
Continue until you reach the 42nd day or end the session when testing.
7. Run and Test Locally
Test your solution repeatedly to tune it before the "battle mode."
With this setup, you’re ready to start coding an efficient solution for the hackathon! Let me know if you'd like help with specific functions, algorithms, or API handling!
